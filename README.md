# How it works ?

KAView is a Sugar-Web activity, it could work both into Sugar Learning platform and in Sugarizer.
KAView embed few videos locally other are loaded dynamically from Khan Academy servers so it will need an Internet connection.

Optionnally you could setup KAView to access videos from a local server if you had a copy of Khan Academy videos.
